       |🧝‍♂️ My clever little elves have been working hard to help me bring some holiday magic to the wonderful folks at Innopolis University.
       |
       |🎁 They've created this special bot just for you, so you can join in the fun and share the warmth of the season with nice gifts!
       |
       |Are you ready for a ✨ miracle ✨?

       |🤫 Meanwhile, let me explain you how Secret Santa works:
       |
       |🤞 First, each participant shares a bit about themselves - their likes, dislikes, something they would really appreciate, and something they are allergic to, so that the Secret Santa can choose the perfect gift!
       |
       |🎲 Next, each participant becomes a secret Santa for a random other participant, someone becomes a Secret Santa for them
       |
       |🎊 And on the appointed day, all the participants gather at the party and receive their gifts! Yay!
       |
       |📜 However, there are several important rules and dates for each participant. Are you listening carefully?
       |""".stripMargin

  def rulesReplyButton(): String =
    s"""I'm all ears"""

  def timeline(): String = {
    s"""👍 Good to hear!
       |
       |So, please, pay attention to the following points:
       |1️⃣ You need to specify your preferences in the bot before **December 12, 20:00**, otherwise you will not participate
       |
       |2️⃣ On **December 13**, you will receive the name of the person and his preferences to prepare a gift
       |
       |3️⃣ You need to prepare present:
       | • The maximum value of the gift is 300-500 rubles
       | • You need to make and **bring it to the office 319** before **December 19 17:00**
       | • Add the note or little postcard, which **includes the name of the person** for whom the present is
       |
       |4️⃣ Pick up your gift on **December 20** at the office 319
       |
       |❗ If you leave early, you can pick up your gift from office 319 from 9:00 to 18:00 from Monday to Thursday, on Friday until 16:45, **please notify the keepers of gifts (office 319 employees) in advance**
       |
